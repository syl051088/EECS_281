The files spec-L.txt and spec-M.txt are the first input
files from the project specification; spec-pipe-L.txt and
spec-pipe-M.txt are the input files from the Appendix that
require you to use a pipe to find the Countess.

The Sample-Small and Sample-Big input files were generated
by the same program that created most of the input files
used by the autograder.

The output file names indicate the flags used (sl is stack
mode, list output, etc.).

The small input files took about 0.01 seconds or less to
complete.  The large input files were under 1 second.
Your times may vary due to hardware, so don't use these
as a strict guide; that's what the autograder is there
for.

Also be aware that if you're inside of an IDE, you'll
have much longer times, because they create debug builds
by default, NOT optimized for speed!
